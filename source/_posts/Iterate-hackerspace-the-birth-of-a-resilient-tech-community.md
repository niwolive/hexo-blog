That would probably be one of the few definitions I'd give to this word, depending on the context. It matches how I feel about the {% post_link From-free-roaming-to-discipline "eastward journey from France" %} that I brought to an end last month.
Today I want pay a tribute to the community in which I spent the most time during that journey. They helped me figure what I can do for people, where it is I can bring value.

When I searched for « Hackerspace Yerevan » on the Web, no obvious result appeared in the first place, except a page on someone's personal site saying that they were looking into creating such a space and were looking for opportunities and people to join. That person was Edgar Aroutiounian. After he offered me to crash at his place a couple of nights, things quickly became very exciting. He hailed from San Francisco, and I could feel that he had very strong professional ethics. I remember Edgar asking me what work I was doing and me answering "Web development". Then he asked something like « Do you do it for real? Professionally? » and I answered defensively « yeah, of course, I do it for like 10 years now ». This was me helplessly trying to convince myself... I started to code 10 years earlier, yet I was nowhere nearly as experienced as I'd wished, and though I worked in a few companies and tought before, I had never really fully committed to become a professional software engineer.

Edgar had just visited the space that had offered to host the hackerspace, and it was nothing like the grungy basement for nerds that I had in mind. The IBM Innovative Solution & Technologies Center (ISTC) was just about to launch, and promising to become the go-to place for co-working and entrepreuneurs in Yerevan, and they would even provide latest hardware and more. How cool!


## Where tech communities matter 

I don't know much of the of the story that made Armenia what it is today. Some parts of the story show in the architecture, some show via the spoken and written languages, the plentiful traditions, the music, the crafts people keep making... However, beyond the cultural wealth of the country, the political, social and economical situations seem tough. I met kids who'd had to work for their families instead of going to school, and fathers who'd had to spend most of their time far from home (e.g. in Russia) to make proper income and people who had to come all the way from Մեղրի (Meghri - far south Armenia) to Երևան (Yerevan - the capital), to get decent (?) medical treatment. Most strikingly, I met kids aged 17 who were amazingly brillant developers, yet will have to put their dreams aside turned 18 to join the army and likely be brought to the most disturbed area of the armed conflict with Azerbaijan, to defend their country.

Edgar told me the day me met « I'm here to help ». I wasn't quite sure what he meant back then. Yet soon after starting to work with him, I was literally amazed. His confidence and « let's get started » attitude just made things come true. He lead open workshops from day one, teaching the skills the youth of Armenia needs to become professional programmers.
Every day more people where coming to learn modern Javascript, Linux, Computer Science Theory and more. In less that a week we had over thirty people showing up, and even better, the same people kept coming!

A community of programmers was born, in a place of where it can have genuine social impact. And even better, this community had developed habits that supports collaboration, and help their members become autonomous learners.


## The rise of autonomous changemakers

In Iterate, everyone is seen as a fellow contributor rather than a teacher or student. Each person is encouraged to contribute to any of our open-source projects, regardless of their proficiency. Workshops are code jams, were people chime in with one another to build something. It is a common pattern to see five or six people around one computer, on which something particularily exciting is happening. Review nights, as promoted by Edgar, help people check how good they become at tackling simple problems in a short amount of time. Here is an example of one he wrote a while back:

These small challenges help you measure how much of a specific topic you retained as skills, while helping to gain confidence, and building portfolios ready for potential employers. They helped constantly push learners at the edge of their skillset, expanding it.

When asked for something, Edgar would often look around the room and find some other contributor that was just one step ahead and ask them to pair with whoever was stuck. 

He would encouraged people to try and fail first, before looking for answers. In this culture, people in-the-know have the responsibility to look after the ones who struggle the most and nudge them towards the path that will help them understand by themselves. Each problem-solving experience is valued as a unique opportunity to learn something greater than just the solution to the problem. They are a proxy to developing autonomous learning. By learning how to learn and how to work with others in addition to how to code, people from the Iterate hackerspace have all they need to start prototype their ideas into real-world ventures that address the issues *they* care about.


## Joining the dots

There would be much more to say about how learning happened in this community. The horizontal, decentralized approach I chose to focus on here was not the only one. Edgar and I were also teaching some of the same people in a more traditional format as part of a study program conducted by the ISTC. Having only classes would hardly ever have created community bounds in the way that the collective learning that takes place in Iterate did. It would also not promote such a learning-by-failing that I believe is key to develop resilience.

Also, I get a sense though people get a higher motivation to get work done when:

- groups are formed spontaneously as the result of a need that emerged organically around a shared purpose, as opposed to a study project anticipated by the « teacher »
- the design of the product is a collective effort, giving group members a sense of co-ownership
- new knowledge is brought in as a way to fix existing issues with a current product/project as opposed as to simply gaining proficiency with tech X

These, along with Edgar's approach to teaching, are takeaways that I will bring to other communities of learners. I feel priviledged to have experienced them, and being around other developers helped me realize how important it is for me to keep learning and teaching on a daily basis.

You can follow the projects that people from Iterate are developing [on Github](https://github.com/iteratehackerspace). Technologies include Node.JS, React, React Native and more. Oh, and surely let us know if you are looking for junior developers for this kind of work.
