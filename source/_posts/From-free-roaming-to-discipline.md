To the students in ISTC, Yerevan, Armenia, and people from the [Iterate hackerspace](). To Edgar, our mentor. And to aspiring sailor-developers pondering on how to set sail.

2016 was the year I caught my bearings. Not specifically through waters, though they were definitely involved when I paddled down the Danube on my eastward journey overland from France. 

Early that year, my ambition was to learn to work as a developer while travelling. The issue was that though it had been about 3 years I got my MSc in Software Engineering, my github activity looked like this:

And to be honest, I was having an awful time at programming. Most of all code I was writing was a webshop for [Tealure](http://tealure.com), back then Ruby on Rails + AngularJS. We had just taken an intern to assist me in the works, but clearly, I was lacking a fair amount of capacity and confidence to stretch to mentoring while my partner and founder Ernestas Klevas was dreaming big on the next steps for having our tea reach more hands and help more people in Nepal.

In parallel to this I was also investing a fair amount of time building my own freelance/consultant venture from the ground up. I was believing that, with a bit of commitment and consistency I could totally work 10-15 hours a week on some hourly-contracts (which I would surely find on the way...), and that it would cover my monthly expenses while paying back my student loan...

I was so *naively* confident that I already planned holidays with my peers early in the journey, and as I was running late to arrive in time to meet them in Blugaria, I decided not to work until the end of my Kayak trip from Budapest, Hungary to Belgrade, Serbia. 

Serbia struck me in many ways. It was the first country I visited that had a strong contrast with EU countries. First off, when I was still paddling towards Belgrade, people were impressively prone to smile/nod/wave at me, or even shout out loud for company in their summer batch (which wouldn't have passed any EU regulations for sure). Belgrade taught me that living like a vagabond (sleeping in parks, moving around with my valuables, gathering free food) can indeed have undesirable side-effects (I needed to live it to believe that some people *do* shake you up in the middle of the night - even if all they can get from you is 2 euros and a 4-years-old pair of shoes)... 

It's at about this time I realized I would need more stability and predictability if I was to make a living while travelling. Still, my time in Serbia was reaching to an end, and in spite of the many hours spent at the gaming club (the most cost-effective office I could find), my time went mostly into Tealure and there was still no paid gig at the horizon.

It is at this stage that it became obvious that I would not be able to be productive unless I had a reliable place to work from, and that this should not change too often.

Once parted from my peers after some epic hiking and cycling in Bulgaria and Turkey, I went towards Armenia as fast as affordable buses and hitch-hiking would allow. My idea was to settle down for a few week doing freelance work in a place where food and accommodation would be cost-effective.

Way too often I faced issues I didn't know how to solve, and it repeatedly happened than a week or more would pass by without I could find a solution.

In hindsight, this is why:

1. I did not have the drive to learn AngularJS properly
2. My problem-solving approach was terribly inneficient: just Google it up and see what others do
3. The scope of my work was so broad that I simply didn't know what I should learn first (backend, frontend, devops...)


Stumble upon each little gravel on the way

....

My issue solving pattern was the following


Tealure, a venture I co-founded with Ernestas Klevas .... and gradually injecting our own React web components in it. You can find the code on Github.



 I believe that constantly changing surroundings has played a major role in increasing my ability to learn and adapt. 

One of the best decision I made last year was to give up the Rails+AngularJS project I was developing and pick a SAAS plateform (namely Smoolis) to host Tealure's webshop. 

 I leanrned to catch the wind of Programming. It may

I learned to change course.
