*To the students in ISTC, Yerevan, Armenia, and people from the [Iterate hackerspace](http://iteratehackerspace.com). To Edgar, our mentor. To Sindu, my apprentice. And to aspiring sailor-developers pondering on how to set sail*.

2016 was the year I caught my bearings. Not specifically through waters, though they were definitely involved when I paddled down the Danube on my eastward journey overland from France.

Early that year, my ambition was to learn to work as a developer while travelling.<!-- more --> Most of all code I was writing was a webshop for [Tealure](http://tealure.com), back then on Ruby on Rails + AngularJS. It had been about 3 years I'd got my MSc in Software Engineering, yet I often felt underqualified and the time I spent programming was not that fun. 

Way too often I faced issues I didn't know how to solve, and it repeatedly happened than a week or more would pass by without I could find a solution.
I was overwhelemed with feature requests and bugs and was constantly hitting walls because of using  tools that I knew too little about. AngularJS for one, but also Javascript, the language. More importantly I was also lacking a sense of purpose, a learning path, and a systemic problem-solving approach better than « just Google it up and see what others do ».
I seemed doomed to stumble upon each little gravel on the way, and was paralised by the multiplicity of domains I'd need to improve at to do my job productively (backend, frontend, devops, SEO...).

We had just taken an intern to assist me in the works, but clearly, I was lacking a fair amount of capacity and confidence to stretch to mentoring while my partner and founder Ernestas Klevas was dreaming big on the next steps for having our tea reach more hands and help more people grow crops in Nepal with our cooperative.

In parallel to this I was also investing time to build my own freelance venture from the ground up. I was believing that, with a bit of commitment and consistency I could totally work 10-15 hours a week on some hourly-contracts (which I would surely find on the way), and that it would cover my monthly expenses while paying back my student loan.

Even before I went onto the Danube, little of my time in cities went into productive work. I was quite busy maintaining the frugality of the lifestyle I used to favor: sleeping in public parks, gathering free food from farmers markets and bakeries, mapping the most reliable public Wifi around, charging my electronic devices with a solar panel when the sun was out... This lifestyle had many aspects I enjoyed, but it was distraction-prone by design, and I required too much day-to-day practical thinking to productively dive into whatever work I wished got done.

I was so *naively* confident that productivity would come in due time, that I already planned holidays with my peers early in the journey, and as I was running late to meet them in Blugaria, I decided not to work until my Kayak trip would be over.

Serbia struck me in many ways. It was the first country I visited that had a strong contrast with EU countries. When I was still paddling towards Belgrade, fishermen were very prone to smile at me, and people would often shout out for a visit at their summer shacks. I got hosted, fed, and dressed by hospitable serbs who offered me comfort at the toughest times. 
In contrast, Belgrade also taught me that living like a vagabond can indeed have undesirable side-effects - some people *do* shake you up in the middle of your peaceful night in the park, and will use *whatever works* to get what they value, even if that's 2 euros and a 4-years-old pair of shoes... 

It's at about this time I realized I would need more stability and predictability if I was to make a living while travelling. I adopted the habit of going to the gamers club, a cheap place where I could hook up a screen to my nomad-friendly computer, for which my partner [Yi Chen Z](https://en.pinkoi.com/store/foufouzi) had crafted a super nice case <3!

By the time I was to leave Serbia, my fidelity to the gamers club allowed me to act upon the best realization I had while Kayaking. I needed a break from doing web development and maintenance for Tealure. I moved our webshop from a custom Rails + AngularJS stack to a SAAS plateform (namely Smoolis) who'd handle most of the devops, product development, maintenance and still meet our requirements. The best part was that it actually cut the running costs to a third! At a stage where our sales didn't allow to pay for the Heroku Postgres monthly fee alone, this decision had benefits on all levels. 

Yet there still was no paid gig on the horizon, and I was acutely aware that I'd need to fix my finances pretty soon. By then, I knew I was not going to be productive unless I had a reliable place to work from, and that this should not change too often. After some epic hiking and cycling in Bulgaria and Turkey with my peers, I decided to go towards Armenia as fast as affordable buses and hitch-hiking would allow. My idea was to settle down for a few weeks do freelance work in a place where food and accommodation would be cost-effective. 


## Armenia, the turning point

Armenia is where I met Edgar Aroutiounian, whom I've been assisting at getting a hackerspace going in Yerevan. This deserves {% post_link Iterate-hackerspace-the-birth-of-a-resilient-tech-community a story on its own %}. This is also a land where I felt welcome and comfortable from day one. A few days after arrival, I somewhat magically stumbled upon [the blog article](http://goodgirlgonenomad.com/armenia-yerevan-and-travel-buddies/) of a japanese nomad girl who mentioned a grandmother's place that turned into a guesthouse, and it seemed to even beat the high hospitality and afordability standards that I had. After she sent me a few pictures from instructions written in a Notebook (in Japanese), I eventually found the place, and Lida.

Her place was the perfect environment for me to take a break from journeying. Uncluttered, simple.  Kept lively by the few occasional travellers, but mostly by her two grandsons in their early teens. I lived in her basement. I do believe that lacking access to a shower and washing my clothes by hand every week helped me appreciate things that I'd otherwise had taken for granted. Though we didn't speak a language in common, wisdom was shining through the way she raised her grandchildren, how she recieved her neighbours to advice or comfort them, the way she kept talking to me in Russian and Armenian, assured that the tone and non-verbal expressions she used would carry meaning beyond that of words, which would leave me with a good-enough *feel* - if not understanding - of what she meant.

But above all, what Lida demonstrated on a daily basis was something I lacked so much all these years. Discipline. She acted consistently with assurance and upon deeply ingrained knowledge. 

I don't know how she learned to do so, but seing this in her brought me back to a feeling of the past - a need for some kind of guidance to help me sense what I ought to be doing with this life. Living half a year in an Ashram a year earlier had brought me some methods to seek for these answers, as well as more tolerance and open-mindedness, especially in regards to accepting there might not be one Truth on anything, but rather complementing perspectives, some of which rational, other esoteric, but none worthier than any another in the togetherness of All. Yet still, the path ahead was windy, 
there seem to constantly be a turn right ahead, and a great unknown after that.

## Two resources that helped

This brought me to try a mobile app called « The Fabulous ». It brings together learnings from different fields of psycology with teachings from various spiritual movements to help you feel content with your life. You chose from a catalog of « journeys » based on what area you'd like to improve in your life and the app will help you by giving you challenges to overcome everyday, most of which you'll have to repeat several days in a row to complete. The idea is to help you develop habits that make you feel good and achieve more of the things that genuinely matter to you whilst giving up the things that hold you back. The two journeys I followed aimed to make you « feel energized » and « strengthen your self-control ». I was very perplex when I started out, and sometimes thought that the stories they were sharing gave an over-simplistic picture of common problems, and that the solutions might not apply to me. However, by keeping the commitment, I gradually learned that it was not so much about how good was the app, but rather how good I was at using the advices from the app in a way that would support my wellbeing. And for me, that worked pretty well. I developped different kinds of « rituals » throughout the day based on the knowledged shared and what I wanted to achieve, and that helped me bring consistency to my schedule. I also learned a bunch about humman psychology in the process and how tools like « commitment devices », « performance statements », and « visual rehersals » can help pre-condition your mind and affect how you might react to any specific situation.

During that time in Armenia, I was also reading *Soft Skills* by Jason Sonmez. This is a book on which I have mixed opinions, but which boosted my productivity and helped me develop my own system for organizing my work along different cycles matching different level of granularity of goals that I set to myself. It is targetted specifically to software developers and covers many non-tech topics ranging from marketting to spirituality or fitness. While the author gives more importance to performance, competition, physical considerations and being wealthy than I'd wish he did, I found that many of his advices were to the point in areas such as organizing your work, starting out as an entrepreneur and embracing a mindset that supports feeling good with whatever you do (or don't). He also convinced me to give a proper try to the Pomodoro technique, mostly by emphasising how impactful it is to have a unit to track (and predict) how much time will go into different tasks (I know do it for 3 months and agree there).

During my 4 months in Armenia, it slowly dawned on me that the overland trip to Taiwan would have to be cancelled as I just wouldn't be able to pay back the loan and keep travelling in the same time. It surely didn't feel good when I realised that, but I found peace with going with the best alternative, which was to fly to Taiwan and join my partner there. She had been waiting for a while already, and a bit of stability and togetherness wouldn't hurt for sure. I'm now focusing on exploring the tech community here and further specialising my work before selecting some freelancing work. It also had been a while I heard of a cool community named [g0v](http://g0v.asia/). They are working on civic-tech, empowering individuals to achieve what matters to them and society. Could be something worthwile to contribute to.
