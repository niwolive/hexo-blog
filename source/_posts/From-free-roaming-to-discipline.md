*To the students in ISTC, Yerevan, Armenia, and people from the [Iterate hackerspace](). To Edgar, our mentor. And to aspiring sailor-developers pondering on how to set sail*.

2016 was the year I caught my bearings. Not specifically through waters, though they were definitely involved when I paddled down the Danube on my eastward journey overland from France.

Early that year, my ambition was to learn to work as a developer while travelling. It had been about 3 years I got my MSc in Software Engineering, yet the record of my open-source activity was near blank and to be honest, I was having an awful time at programming. Most of all code I was writing was a webshop for [Tealure](http://tealure.com), back then on Ruby on Rails + AngularJS. We had just taken an intern to assist me in the works, but clearly, I was lacking a fair amount of capacity and confidence to stretch to mentoring while my partner and founder Ernestas Klevas was dreaming big on the next steps for having our tea reach more hands and help more people grow crops in Nepal with our cooperative.

In parallel to this I was also investing a fair amount of time building my own freelance/consultant venture from the ground up. I was believing that, with a bit of commitment and consistency I could totally work 10-15 hours a week on some hourly-contracts (which I would surely find on the way), and that it would cover my monthly expenses while paying back my student loan...

I was so *naively* confident that I already planned holidays with my peers early in the journey, and as I was running late to arrive in time to meet them in Blugaria, I decided not to work until the end of my Kayak trip from Budapest to Belgrade. 

Serbia struck me in many ways. It was the first country I visited that had a strong contrast with EU countries. When I was still paddling towards Belgrade, fishermen were impressively prone to smile at me, and people would often shout out for a visit at their summer shacks. Belgrade also taught me that living like a vagabond (sleeping in parks, moving around with my valuables, gathering free food) can indeed have undesirable side-effects - some people *do* shake you up in the middle of the night, even if all they can get from you is 2 euros and a 4-years-old pair of shoes... 

It's at about this time I realized I would need more stability and predictability if I was to make a living while travelling. I adopted the habit of going to the gamers club, a cheap place where I could hook up a screen to my nomad-friendly computer, for which my partner [Yi Chen Z]() had crafted a super nice case <3!

By the time I was to leave Serbia, my time in the gamers club allowed me to act upon the best realization I had while Kayaking. I needed a break from doing web development and maintenance for Tealure. I moved our webshop from a custom Rails + AngularJS stack to a SAAS plateform (namely Smoolis) who'd handle all the maintenance, product development and meet our main requirements. The best part was that it actually cut the running costs to a third. At a stage where our sales didn't allow to pay for Heroku Postgres monthly fee alone, this decision had benefits on all levels. 

Yet there still was no paid gig on the horizon, and was acutely aware that I'd need to fix my finances pretty soon. By then, knew I was not going to be productive unless I had a reliable place to work from, and that this should not change too often. After some epic hiking and cycling in Bulgaria and Turkey with my peers, I decided to go towards Armenia as fast as affordable buses and hitch-hiking would allow. My idea was to settle down for a few weeks do freelance work in a place where food and accommodation would be cost-effective. 

Why I found there deserves [a story on its own]().

Her place was the perfect environment for me to focus. Uncluttered, simple. There was even no showers and I'd wash my clothes by hand every sunday.

I once got told at work that I should shower more often.

Soft skills

// faboulous

// Plane instead of walk

 I believe that constantly changing surroundings has played a major role in increasing my ability to learn and adapt. 


 I leanrned to catch the wind of Programming. It may

I learned to change course.
