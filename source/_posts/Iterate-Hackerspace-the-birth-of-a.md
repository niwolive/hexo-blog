// Situation of armenia

// How I liked armenia

In many ways, Armenia was all I could have wished for, and more. When searched for « Hackerspace Yerevan » on the Web, no obvious result appeared in the first place, except a page on someone's personal site saying that they were about to create one and were looking for a place and people to join. That person was Edgar Aroutiounian. After he offered me to crash at his place a couple of nights, things quickly became very exciting. He hailed from San Francisco, and I could feel that he had very strong professional ethics. I remember Edgar asking me what work I was doing and me answering "Web development". Then he asked something like « Do you do it for real? Professionally? » and I answered defensively « yeah, of course, I do it for like 10 years now ». In trurth, I started to code 10 years back, but could hardly ever make it to hone my skills with consistency till then.

Edgar had just visited the space that had offered to host the hackerspace, and it was nothing like the grungy basement for nerds that I had in mind. The IBM Innovative Solution & Technologies Center (ISTC) was just about to launch, and promising to become the go-to place for co-working and entrepreuneurs in Yerevan, and they would even provide latest hardware and more. How cool!

Edgar amazed me in more than one way. I was mostly struck by his confidence and « let's get started » attitude. He lead open workshops from day one, teaching the skills the youth of Armenia needs to become professional programmers.
Every day more people where coming to learn modern Javascript, Linux, Computer Science Theory and more. In less that a week we had over thirty people showing up, and even better, the same people kept coming.

In Iterate, everyone is seen as a fellow contributor rather than a teacher or student. Each person is encouraged to contribute to any of our open-source projects, regardless of their proficiency. Workshops are code jams, were people chime in with one another to build something. It is a common pattern to see 5 of 6 people around one computer, on which something particularily exciting is happening. Review nights, as promoted by Edgar, help people check how good they become at tackling simple problems in a short amount of time. Here is an example of one he wrote a while back:

I found this kind of small challenges to be incredibly valuable. Not only they help you measure how much of a specific topic you retained as skills, but they also help gain confidence, and build portfolios that learners can then show to potential employers.



Here is a list of Takeaways: 
I found the learning pace that Edgar was taking was incredibly fast,
- When Edgar would often look around the room and find some other contributor that was just one step ahead and ask them to pair with whoever was stuck.
- In all instances, he'd never give the answer to a problem, and rather point the learner towards the direction that would help them solve the issue themselves. 
- Though he refused giving answers as to maximize problem-solving experiences, Edgar was striving to consistently nudge the people who struggled the most in the right direction. 

He laid the foundation for a community of young people to form around a common belief - that the youth of Armenia could take a major stake in creating leading software systems to power society.

d experience (again) how teaching is an intrinsic part of learning, and how rewarding it is to contribute to the progress of fellow learners (which we are all meant to stay for a lifetime).



After 4 months in Armenia, I now relocated to Taiwan where s



Way too often I faced issues I didn't know how to solve, and it repeatedly happened than a week or more would pass by without I could find a solution.

In hindsight, this is why:

1. I did not have the drive to learn AngularJS properly
2. My problem-solving approach was terribly inneficient: just Google it up and see what others do
3. The scope of my work was so broad that I simply didn't know what I should learn first (backend, frontend, devops...)
